# RaspyStream
This is a simple-to-use tool to stream on Twitch or other streaming services from a Raspberry Pi and the new camera module v3. There are a lot of projects like this online the problem is that most of them use the old Raspivid which is not supported anymore, that's why I created this project adapting old programs to the new Libcam library.
